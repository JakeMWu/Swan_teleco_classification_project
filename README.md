# Swan_teleco classification project
A team project completed whilst at Digital Futures to classify customers at risk of churning.
We also aimed to identify key factors which influenced churn and actions that could be taken to minimize this risk
at signup and on an ongoing basis.

It is comprised of a primary notebook in which we do the FE, EDA and modelling as well as an information deck for communicating the key insights and actions.
